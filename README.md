# Python3-Magic-8-Ball
Magic 8 Ball written in Python 3

I created this program to see if I could write the Magic 8 Ball in Python like I did in C.\
It was a fun program to write.  It was much easier than the C version.

I learned a lot about using arguments to the program.  
This is a good program for beginners to try.
